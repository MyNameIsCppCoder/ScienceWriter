  "overview": "Artificial intelligence (AI) involves creating computer systems capable of performing tasks that typically require human intelligence.  These tasks include learning, reasoning, problem-solving, perception, and natural language understanding. AI systems achieve this through algorithms and models that analyze data, identify patterns, and make predictions or decisions.  Different approaches exist, from rule-based systems to machine learning (learning from data) and deep learning (using artificial neural networks with multiple layers).  AI is transforming numerous industries, from healthcare to finance.",

    "title": "Machine Learning",
    "example": "Spam filters utilize machine learning.  They analyze emails, learning to identify patterns in spam (e.g., suspicious links, unsolicited offers) and legitimate emails.  Based on this learned pattern, they classify incoming emails as spam or not spam, improving their accuracy over time through exposure to more data."

    "title": "Natural Language Processing (NLP)",
    "example": "Chatbots use NLP to understand and respond to human language. They process user input, analyze its meaning, and generate appropriate responses.  This involves techniques like text analysis, sentiment analysis, and language generation.  For example, a customer service chatbot can answer frequently asked questions and guide users through simple troubleshooting steps."

    "title": "Computer Vision",
    "example": "Self-driving cars rely heavily on computer vision.  Cameras capture images of the surroundings, which are then processed by AI algorithms to identify objects like pedestrians, other vehicles, and traffic signs.  This information allows the car to navigate safely and make decisions like braking or changing lanes.  Object recognition is a crucial component of computer vision."
